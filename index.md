# <span style="color:#00c7b7"> Welcome to JAMStack Expert Pages

When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.

The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

# What is the JAMStack?

You may have already seen or worked on a JAMstack site! They do not have to include all attributes of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. They might be built using by hand, or with Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt, Next, Gatsby, or another static site generator...

The thing that they all have in common is that they don’t depend on a web server.

### JavaScript
Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.

### APIs
All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

### Markup
Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

# <span style="color:#00c7b7"> Why the JAMstack?


## Better Performance

Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.

## Higher Security

With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.

## Cheaper, Easier Scaling

When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.

## Better Developer Experience

Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.

### <span style="color:#3e70b1"> Auth0

#### Auth0 Overview

Auth0 provides authentication and authorization as a service.

We are here to give developers and companies the building blocks they need to secure their applications without having to become security experts.

You can connect any application (written in any language or on any stack) to Auth0 and define the identity providers you want to use (how you want your users to log in).

Based on your app's technology, choose one of our SDKs (or call our API), and hook it up to your app. Now each time a user tries to authenticate, Auth0 will verify their identity and send the required information back to your app.

#### Why use Auth0?

Take a look at just a few of Auth0's use cases:

  - You built an awesome app and you want to add user authentication and authorization. Your users should be able to log in either with username/password or with their social accounts (such as Facebook or Twitter). You want to retrieve the user's profile after the login so you can customize the UI and apply your authorization policies.
  - You built an API and you want to secure it with OAuth 2.0.
  - You have more than one app, and you want to implement Single Sign-on (SSO).
  - You built a JavaScript front-end app and a mobile app, and you want them both to securely access your API.
  - You have a web app which needs to authenticate users using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
  - You believe passwords are broken and you want your users to log in with one-time codes delivered by email or SMS.
  - If one of your user's email addresses is compromised in some site's public data breach, you want to be notified, and you want to notify the users and/or block them from logging in to your app until they reset their password.
  - You want to act proactively to block suspicious IP addresses if they make consecutive failed login attempts, in order to avoid DDoS attacks.
  - You are part of a large organization who wants to federate their existing enterprise directory service to allow employees to log in to the various internal and third-party applications using their existing enterprise credentials.
  - You don't want (or you don't know how) to implement your own user management solution. Password resets, creating, provisioning, blocking, and deleting users, and the UI to manage all these. You just want to focus on your app.
  - You want to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) when your users want to access sensitive data.
  - You are looking for an identity solution that will help you stay on top of the constantly growing compliance requirements of SOC2, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others.
  - You want to use analytics to track users on your site or application. You plan on using this data to create funnels, measure user retention, and improve your sign-up flow.

As JAMstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying hundreds of files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state while the process completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do “atomic deploys,” where no changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded.
